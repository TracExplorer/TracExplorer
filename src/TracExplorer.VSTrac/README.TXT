DESCRIPTION
VSTrac is an addin for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 which allows for integration with Trac (http://trac.edgewall.com/) systems using the XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin). It allows configuring many servers, querying, modifying, and adding new tickets as well as editing wiki pages.
